Hello and thanks for popping in!  
Scrapecrow is a free educational resource on the subject of web-scraping and all of it's related bits (reverse-engineering, data management, testing etc.)  

Goal of this blog platform is to provide a community for these subjects that are unsurprisingly very secretive. If you'd like to contribute an article or fix any mistakes feel free to open up an issue or pull request on github: [granitosaurus/scrapecrow]

If you'd like to support this project you can [hire me!] or simply pay it forward.
