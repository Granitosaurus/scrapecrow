Hello and thanks for popping in!  

My name is Bernard and I've been working with a lot of web-scrapers, specifically in Python programming language.  
I found Scrapecrow as a free educational resource on this incredible subject of web-scraping and all of it's related bits (reverse-engineering, data management, testing etc.)  

Goal of this blog platform is to provide a community for these subjects that are unsurprisingly very secretive. Main principles of this blog platform is to:

- Teach by example.  
- For intermediate/advanced python developers.  
- Reach for best web-scraping practices 
- Explore new and unknown

If you'd like to contribute an article or fix any mistakes feel free to open up an issue or pull request on github: [granitosaurus/scrapecrow]  
If you'd like to support this project you can [hire me!] or [buy me a ☕ of coffee][coffee]
