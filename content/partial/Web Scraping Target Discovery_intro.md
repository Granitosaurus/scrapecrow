Most web scrapers are made up of two core parts: finding products on the website and actually scraping them. The former is often referred to as "target discovery" step. For example to scrape product data of an e-commerce website we would need to find urls to each individual product and only then we can scrape their data.

Discovering targets to scrape in web scraping is often a challenging and important task. This series of blog posts tagged with [#discovery-methods] (also see [main article]) covers common target discovery approaches.
